problem: give your a string only contains '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' , ']' ,determine if the input is valid.

eg: {()[]{}} is true ,{]}() is false

analysis:

I have to say the problem is hard to me. At first , i want count each pair is even ï¼Œeg (sum('(') + sum(')'))%2 == 0.
But this way cann't confirm the order.
